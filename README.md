- 👋 Hi, I’m @AdiaLewis
- 👀 I’m interested in remote work in data, accounting, analysis and the like.  
- My degree is in Accounting and I've worked various positions;
  - library purchasing, retirement processing, tax professional, 
  - customer service, state eligibility coordinator, and more.
- Data Science is a natural path to take for me because I love reading, communications,and research.  I will be able to gather, wrangle and interprwet data to implement
  - ideas that will provide recommendations for smoother operations, increased customer care, and larger profits for owners and investors.
- I've done a lot of the Raw Data entry in the past and the post familiar with data software applications. I visualize and have visualized my working with the 
   - analytical part of the pipeline.  I believe the reading of date and clarification of data will be where I will flourish as I learn Data Science as a whole.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning new concepts to sharpen curent skills while building new skills; as I come accrossed the need skills for continuous improvment.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on - My plans with my Accounting degree was to work in financal and business consulting services. My desired industry is by far in the finanacial areas of library, education, 
  - business growth and security.
